# Pharmacy Formulary RAG Agent

A production-ready, table-aware pharmacy formulary retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent that helps nurses find medication coverage information quickly and accurately. The system extracts tables and text from pharmacy formulary PDFs, stores them in a vector database, and delivers structured, nurse-friendly answers in a web UI.

## üåü Features

- **Table-Aware Extraction**: Extracts both tables and text from formulary PDFs using Camelot and PyMuPDF
- **Structured Output**: Delivers markdown-formatted, emoji-enhanced responses optimized for nurses
- **Vector Search**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions) with Pinecone vector database
- **Memory Optimized**: Batch processing designed for Mac M3 hardware (18GB RAM)
- **Production Ready**: Includes Render deployment configuration and web UI
- **Multi-Insurance Support**: Handles queries for all insurance plans with structured formatting

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your API keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key
- `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: Your Pinecone index URL (e.g., "https://yourindex.svc.environment.pinecone.io")
- `LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY`: (Optional) Your LlamaParse API key

### 3. Create a Pinecone Index

Create a Pinecone serverless index named "finalpharm" with 3072 dimensions (for compatibility with OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large):

```bash
python create_3072d_index.py
```

### 4. Add PDF Documents

Create a `data` directory and add your insurance formulary PDFs:

```bash
mkdir -p data
```

## üîÑ Processing PDFs

The system offers multiple PDF processing options:

### Camelot Processor (Recommended)

```bash
python process_with_camelot.py
```

This uses Camelot for table extraction and PyMuPDF for text extraction. No external dependencies required.

### Unstructured.io Processor (Alternative)

```bash
python process_with_unstructured.py
```

Requires Poppler to be installed on your system.

### LlamaParse Processor (Alternative)

```bash
python process_with_llamaparse.py
```

## üöÄ Deployment Status

- **PDF Processing**: ‚úÖ Complete - 31 PDFs processed with 1989 total chunks
- **Vector Database**: ‚úÖ Ready - All chunks stored in Pinecone "finalpharm" index (3072d)
- **Web Application**: ‚úÖ Ready for deployment to Render
- **Deployment Checks**: ‚úÖ All checks passed (environment, dependencies, connections)

## üåê Deploying to Render

This repository includes a `render.yaml` file for easy deployment to Render:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Render will automatically detect the configuration
3. Set the required environment variables in the Render dashboard
4. Deploy the application

The application includes health check endpoints and proper logging for production monitoring.

Requires a LlamaParse API key.

## üíæ Memory Usage Optimizations

The PDF processing includes several memory optimizations for Mac M3 hardware:
- Processes PDFs in small batches (2 at a time)
- Uses text chunking with table awareness
- Clears memory after each embedding is created
- Includes delays between batches to allow memory cleanup

## üè• Supported Insurance Providers

The system is designed to work with formularies from:
- CountyCare (primary focus)
- Blue Cross Blue Shield
- UnitedHealthcare
- Cigna
- Meridian
- Wellcare
- Other Medicaid/Medicare providers

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface

Run the web interface locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

Or deploy to Render using the included `render.yaml` configuration.
