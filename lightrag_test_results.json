To provide accurate information, I would need to consult an official and current source, such as the BCBS formulary or their customer service.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to proceed:\n\n1. **Check BCBS Formulary**: Visit the official BCBS website or contact their customer service to access the most current formulary information. This will provide details on the tier placement of Advair and any associated requirements.\n\n2. **Consider Alternatives**: If Advair is not favorably covered, consider alternative medications within the same class, such as Wixela Inhub or AirDuo RespiClick, which might have different coverage terms.\n\n3. **Verify Requirements**: Confirm if there are any prior authorization or step therapy requirements for Advair or its alternatives.\n\n4. **Estimate Costs**: Once you have the tier information, you can estimate the copay based on the tier and the patient's specific plan details.\n\nIf you have access to BCBS resources or can contact them directly, that would be the best way to obtain the most accurate and up-to-date information.",
